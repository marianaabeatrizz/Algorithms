# Algorithms

This repository contains exercises, practical assignments, and algorithm implementations developed during the Algorithms course.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `AP1mergesort.cpp`: Solution for Practical Assignment 1 using the Merge Sort algorithm.
- `mergeyoutube.cpp`: Merge Sort implementation based on supplementary study (YouTube tutorial).
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Configuration file for building the project using CMake.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Basic data structures (arrays, vectors)
- Sorting algorithms (Merge Sort)
- Standard input/output in C++
- Handling multiple test cases

## 🚀 How to Compile

You can compile the `.cpp` files using `g++`:

```bash
g++ AP1mergesort.cpp -o ap1
./ap1

Or use CMake if you have it configured:
cmake .
make
./ap1
